# Boss Fight Reflection

### Did you get inspiration from a boss from another game? If so, which game? (Minimum 1 Sentence)

> I received inspiration from another 2d platformer project I worked on in a previous class with Mr Kramlich.

### Did you find it easy to create your own mechanics? Which boss mechanics were the easiest to implement? (Minimum 2 Sentences)

> I found it quite frustrating to create many of my own mechanics since most of them had contradictory orders that would confuse the program.  I believe
  the easiest mechanic to implement was the basic left/right movement of the boss.

### What was the hardest part of this project? What did you do to help you get past this part? (Minimum 2 Sentences)

> The hardest part of this project by far was the implementation of a leap attack, which would not operate smoothly or work as ordered no matter how much
  troubleshooting was performed.  I got past this part by fully scrapping the idea and implementing a different concept.

### Debugging is an important part of the iterative design process. Describe a bug you encountered and how you went about fixing it. (Minimum 4 Sentences)

> One bug I had was the program claiming I had open-ended functions, which was preventing the program from properly loading.  It took a while to discover
  the cause, but I eventually found the cause of the issue to be many multi-line comments I had previously made while troubleshooting.  These multi-line
  comments accidentally engulfed endcaps for the functions, which caused these functions to be registered as open-ended.  I fixed this problem by fully
  remopoving the function affected by the bug and rebuilding it from scratch.
